# Text-Prediction
This project is a text prediction, meaning the model has to predict which text out of 2 (A ,B) is easier to understand for a person.

### The project is made with Python and the following main libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn and NLTK

| Library | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)  | Used for natural language processing tasks in Python  |
| stopwords | is a corpus from the nltk library that contains a list of commonly used words in texts that are often ignored in NLP tasks  |
| PorterStemmer  |  is a class from the nltk library that is used for stemming |
| pandas  | useful for data manipulation and analysis |
| numpy  | used for numerical operations in Python  |
| TextBlob  |  library for processing data from a text, provides support in common natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more |
| sklearn.ensemble. RandomForestClassifier  |  is a class for the Random Forest algorithm from the scikit-learn library  |
| sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler | is a class from the scikit-learn library for scaling data between a given minimum and maximum value |
| word_tokenize  | used to tokenize text (split it into individual words) |
| FreqDist | used for counting word frequency  |
| cmudict  | corpus from the nltk library containing phonetic pronunciations of words |
| textstat | Python library for text statistics |
| sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV | help create a grid for obtaining combinations of hyperparameters (cross-validation)|

### The main steps in this project are : text pre-processing, feature exraction, dictionary associations, model training,validation and test.
